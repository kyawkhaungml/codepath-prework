This is my final app walkthrough in GIF with Kap. I couldn't find a way to get a URL from Kap, so I created one from Giphy.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My Favorite 3 Applications:

1. Youtube
- Playlists
- Short run-through of a video when the cursor is placed
- The little blue dots on the subscribed channels when their new content are uploaded
2. Linkedin
- 'My Network' section
- Linkedin Shorts
- 'Catch Up' section
3. Netflix
- 'News and Hot' section
- 'Last call to watch' where the movies that will not be on Netflix soon are listed
- Downloads

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was a bit confused with dragging the buttom on my storyboard to the ViewController class, but I was able to comprehend well the rest of the steps and concepts.
